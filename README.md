- 🌱 I’m currently learning Economic Informatics (ID - group 1118) at CSIE Department, ASE, Bucharest, Romania
- 👀 I’m interested in UX, RAG chatbots, recommendation applications, cybersecurity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Faculty projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am interested in UX and github automatically proposed me bogdan2024-ux instead of bogdan2024 (which was unavailable)
